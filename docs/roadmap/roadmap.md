# Whisper Key Local - Roadmap
@completed.md

## Next
- As a *user* I want an optional **"transcription complete" sound** so I get an audible cue when the result is ready after clicking away — configurable sound path ([#35](https://github.com/PinW/whisper-key-local/pull/35))
- As a *user* I want **ROCm DLLs bundled in the exe** so the portable ROCm build works out of the box without installing HIP SDK or pip packages — bundle `amdhip64_7.dll`, `hipblas.dll`, and other required DLLs from `rocm_sdk_core`/`rocm_sdk_libraries_custom` into the PyInstaller build ([#30](https://github.com/PinW/whisper-key-local/issues/30))

## Bugs
- **ROCm DLL loading broken for official CT2 wheels** - runtime hook (`rth_rocm_paths.py`) looks for `HIP_PATH` env var but official CT2 v4.7.1 ROCm wheel needs `amdhip64_7.dll` + `hipblas.dll` from pip packages (`rocm_sdk_core`, `rocm_sdk_libraries_custom` v7.2), not the HIP SDK installer (which only goes to 7.1.1). Hook doesn't search pip `site-packages`. Also: HIP SDK 7.2 doesn't exist as a Windows installer — only as pip packages from `repo.radeon.com` ([#30](https://github.com/PinW/whisper-key-local/issues/30))
- **No download progress shown** - HuggingFace model download doesn't display any state or progress to the user
- **Ctrl+C doesn't work after HuggingFace download** - shutdown signal not caught
- **(macOS) System freezes on transcription** - needs verification
- **PyAV DLL missing in exe** - `av._core` import fails; `faster-whisper` added PyAV dependency whose DLLs aren't bundled by PyInstaller ([#29](https://github.com/PinW/whisper-key-local/issues/29))
- **CUDA 13.1 fails** - `cublas64_12.dll` is not found or cannot be loaded
- **GPU model switch crash** - upstream CT2 bug, `thread_local` GPU handles corrupt HIP/CUDA on Worker thread teardown ([faster-whisper #71](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/issues/71)). Future option: auto-restart app on model switch in GPU mode

## Backlog

### Voice Commands
- As a *user* I want **voice commands** so I can quickly activate tasks
- As a *user* I want **transcription preset commands** so I can instantly deliver pre-written phrases without recording or transcribing
- As a *user* I want **hotkey-activated commands** so I can bind specific voice commands to custom hotkeys and skip the speech step entirely
- As a *user* I want **command aliases** so I can define multiple trigger phrases for the same command (e.g., "open browser", "launch chrome", and "start browser" all execute the same action)
- As a *user* I want **semantic command matching** so commands are matched intelligently instead of requiring exact phrases (e.g., "open up chrome" still matches "open browser")
- As a *user* I want **parameterized commands** so I can define command templates with variables that are extracted from speech (e.g., "open {filename}" or "search for {query}")
- As a *user* I want **voice commands API** so other apps can do things from whisper key commands
- As a *user* I want **verbal stop recording** command so I don't need to hit the hotkey

### Terminal UI
- As a *user* I want **on-screen hotkey hints** so I can see available controls at a glance like a video game HUD
- As a *user*, I want a **terminal UI** so I can control the app without leaving the command line
- As a *user*, I want a **terminal status bar** so I can see app state, model, and recording status at a glance
- As a *user*, I want **terminal colors and styling** so the CLI feels modern like coding tools (Claude Code, lazygit)
- As a *user*, I want **terminal settings control** so I can change settings interactively without editing YAML
  - As a *user* I want **language selection in CLI** so I can switch transcription language without editing YAML
- As a *user*, I want **wrapped model downloading** so I see a clean progress display and get helpful error messages instead of raw HuggingFace output (symlink errors, cluttered progress bars)

### CLI
- As a *user* I want a **short command alias (`wk`)** in `[project.scripts]` so I can launch the app by typing `wk` instead of `whisper-key`
- As a *user* I want a **CLI interface** so other tools and agents can invoke transcription programmatically
- As a *user* I want to **wrap CLI tools** (e.g., `whisper-key claude`) so I can voice-input directly into any command-line application without switching windows
  - As a *user* I want **additional instances with custom hotkeys** so that I can be keyboard-only when dictating to multiple agents
  - As a *user* I want **hotkey instance management** so that multiple instances will be allowed and work together
- As a *user* I want **agent skill packages** so CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, etc.) can install a whisper-key skill from a marketplace and use the CLI
- As a *user* I want **voice command CLI management** so I can list, add, run, and delete voice commands from the command line
  - `whisper-key commands list` — list all configured voice commands
  - `whisper-key commands add` — add a new voice command
  - `whisper-key commands run <command>` — execute a voice command directly
  - `whisper-key commands delete <command>` — remove a voice command

### Onboarding
- As a *new user* I want **first-run onboarding** so I can configure model, audio device, and auto-paste without editing YAML
  - As a *new user* I want **model selection** so I can choose a Whisper model that balances speed vs accuracy without editing YAML
  - As a *new user* I want **auto GPU detection** so CUDA/ROCm mode is enabled automatically when a compatible GPU is available
  - As a *new user* I want **settings overview** so I can see default settings and change them if I want
    - As a *new user* I want **audio device selection** so I can pick my preferred microphone from a list of detected devices
    - As a *new user* I want **language selection** so I can set my transcription language without editing YAML
    - As a *new user* I want **system tray preference** so I can decide whether to show the tray icon or run in background
    - As a *new user* I want **auto-set key simulation delay based on machine specs** so slower computers don't miss keystrokes during auto-paste
  - As a *new user* I want **auto-paste preference** so I can choose between direct paste or clipboard-only mode

### Transcription History
- As a *user* I want a **transcriptions log** so I can review my past transcriptions and look at accidental cancels or overwrites

### GPU Onboarding
- As a *user* I want **guided GPU setup** so drivers and dependencies are auto-detected, downloaded, and installed through an in-app UI instead of manual steps

### Packaging & Updates
- As a *user*, I want [**pyapp**](https://github.com/ofek/pyapp) so I can install without worrying about python/pip/etc
  - As a *developer*, I want **pyapp** so I can avoid PyInstaller's fragile build process and hidden import headaches
- As a *user*, I want **overlay config** so my settings file only contains my customizations and new defaults are picked up automatically on app updates — switch from full-copy to diff-based save with config versioning and migration framework ([plan](../plans/2026-03-08-0952-overlay-config.md))
- As a *user*, I want **automatic updates** to get new features
- As a *user*, I want **config version tracking with auto-reset on breaking changes** so my settings don't cause errors after major updates ([#22](https://github.com/PinW/whisper-key-local/issues/22))

### macOS
- As a *mac user*, I want **better default hotkey** so fn doesn't conflict with emoji picker
- As a *mac user*, I want **CGEventTap hotkeys** so I can use ESC or Cmd+. to cancel recording
- As a *mac user*, I want **monochrome menu bar icons** so the app conforms to Apple's template icon guidelines

### Hotkeys
- As a *user* I want **hotkey sequence ordering** so more hotkey combos can coexist without conflicting (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+Space vs Alt+Ctrl+Space become distinct sequences)

### Personalization
- As a *user*, I want **custom hotwords** so I can bias the transcription model toward rare words and names that I say often
- As a *user*, I want **post-transcription replacements** so consistent misrecognitions are automatically corrected after transcription (e.g., "see translate two" → "CTranslate2")

### Desktop App

  - As a *Linux user* I want **global hotkeys via evdev** so hotkey detection works on both X11 and Wayland
  - As a *Linux user* I want **key simulation via evdev UInput** so auto-paste works on both X11 and Wayland
  - As a *Linux user* I want **input group permission guidance** so I get clear setup instructions when evdev access is missing
  - As a *Linux user* I want **Linux GPU transcription** so I can use CUDA or ROCm (which works better on Linux than Windows)
- As a *WSL user* I want **WSL support via a Windows hotkey shim** so I can run the app natively in WSL while capturing global hotkeys on the Windows side — small Python shim using ctypes `RegisterHotKey`, communicating over localhost TCP ([research](../research/2026-02-16-wsl-hotkey-shim-research.md))
- As a phone *user*, I want this app on **mobile**

### Transcription Quality
